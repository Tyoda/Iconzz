# Iconzz
A small mod API allowing the easy use of custom icons in the game.

Currently a mod can call addIcon() before the onServerStarted phase, and the icon will be loaded onto the appropriate icon sheet.

Since we're editing the icons sheets anyway, we fixed a few problems, such as
 - Huge bell had no icon
 - Golden mirror had no icon
 - Random lines below halberd
